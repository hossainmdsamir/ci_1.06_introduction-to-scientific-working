#### Answers:
##### Hypothesis:
This paper first details the requirements that an industrial network has to fulfill. It then shows how Ethernet has been enhanced to comply with the real-time requirements in particular in the industrial context. Finally, it shows how the requirements that cannot be fulfilled at layer 2 of the OSI model can be addressed in the higher layers adding functionality to existing standard protocols.
##### Experiment:
- Modifications That Alter Compatibility
In this paper it was focused on alterations to the IEEE 802.3 MAC that make the result incompatible with standard solutions. It was assumed that they can be implemented on off-the-shelf IEEE 802.3 compliant hardware.
Most of the modifications add a new MAC on top of CSMA/CD. All traffic, whether real time or not, is passed to the additional layer that controls the access to the medium. At a higher layer, real-time traffic is either handled by IP/UDP or by separate protocols.
Quite logically, all known types of deterministic MAC have been used. Examples are Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA), masterâ€“slave, token passing , slot reservation , or time packet release . At the same time, some authors have suggested to reuse the MAC schemes of some fieldbuses such as PROFIBUS and WorldFIP on top of IEEE 802.3.
