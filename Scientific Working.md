#### Answers:
##### Hypothesis:
This paper first details the requirements that an industrial network has to fulfill. It then shows how Ethernet has been enhanced to comply with the real-time requirements in particular in the industrial context. Finally, it shows how the requirements that cannot be fulfilled at layer 2 of the OSI model can be addressed in the higher layers adding functionality to existing standard protocols.
##### Experiment:
###### Modifications That Alter Compatibility:
In this paper it was focused on alterations to the IEEE 802.3 MAC that make the result incompatible with standard solutions. It was assumed that they can be implemented on off-the-shelf IEEE 802.3 compliant hardware.
Most of the modifications add a new MAC on top of CSMA/CD, as indicated in Fig. 4. All traffic, whether real time or not, is passed to the additional layer that controls the access to the medium. At a higher layer, real-time traffic is either handled by IP/UDP or by separate protocols.
